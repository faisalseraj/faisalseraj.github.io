During my academic tenure, I embraced freelancing as a means to apply my burgeoning skills and knowledge. Over time, I successfully delivered a diverse range of projects, each a testament to my dedication and adaptability.
      Among these projects were notable creations such as a Keto diet site, a fusion of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles. Additionally, I crafted a dynamic PHP CodeIgniter-powered Point of Sale system, demonstrating my ability to create efficient business solutions.
      My experience grew manifold during my tenure at #Techverx in Lahore, where I actively contributed to five impactful projects, learning and adapting in a dynamic team environment. The opportunity to lead one of these projects not only fortified my technical skills but also sharpened my leadership abilities.
      As a freelancer, I sought challenges that would push my boundaries, culminating in the successful creation of an innovative Restaurant Management Systemâ€”an endeavor that stands as a testament to my commitment to excellence.`
